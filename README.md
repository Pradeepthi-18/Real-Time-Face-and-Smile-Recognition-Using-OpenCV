# Real-Time-Face-and-Smile-Recognition-Using-OpenCV
This project uses OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifiers to detect faces and smiles in real-time using a webcam. When a smile is detected, the program captures and saves the image automatically. The detection is performed using pre-trained Haar cascades for facial and smile recognition.
